Overview
--------

In the Fitting package BuTools provides functions both for fitting and
for the evaluation of the success of the fitting.

For PH and MAP fitting, currently only EM algorithms are implemented, however,
several matching procedures can also be found in the map and ph packages.

To evaluate the fitting results there are functions to compute
the distance between continuous functions given by samples (like pdf, cdf, ccdf, etc.),
and between discrtete functions (like autocorrelation function, etc.).
The efficient calculation of the log-likelihood is also supported.

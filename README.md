## LINE: Performance and Reliability Analysis Engine

Current version: 2.0.0-ALPHA1 (BSD-3 License)

URL: https://github.com/line-solver/line

LINE is a MALAB toolbox for performance and reliability analysis of systems and processes that can be modeled using queueing theory. The engine offers a rich language to specify queueing models and decouples the model description from the solvers used for its solution. This is done through model-to-model transformations that automatically translate the model specification into the input format (or data structure) accepted by the target solver.

Supported models include *extended queueing networks*, both open and closed, and *layered queueing networks*. Models can be solved with either external solvers or native solvers. Wrappers are integrated in LINE that are able to invoke external solvers such as [JMT](http://jmt.sourceforge.net/) and [LQNS](http://www.sce.carleton.ca/rads/lqns/lqn-documentation/) and transparently import back their results in LINE format. Native model solvers written in the MATLAB language are also integrated. They are based on continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC), fluid ordinary differential equations, matrix analytic methods (MAM), normalizing constant analysis, and approximate mean-value analysis (AMVA). 

### Getting started

To get started, either clone the repository ([dev release](https://github.com/line-solver/line)) or uncompress the latest archive ([stable release](https://github.com/line-solver/line/releases)) in the chosen installation folder.

Start MATLAB and change the active directory to the installation folder. Then add all LINE folders to the path
```
addpath(genpath(pwd))
```
Finally, run the LINE demonstrators using
```
allExamples
```

### Documentation
Detailed guidance on how to use LINE is provided in the [User Manual](https://github.com/line-solver/line/raw/master/doc/LINE.pdf).

LINE: Performance and Reliability Analysis Engine

Current version: 2.0.0-ALPHA (BSD-3 License)

URL: https://github.com/line-solver/line

LINE is a MALAB toolbox for performance and reliability analysis of systems and processes that can be modeled using queueing theory. The engine offers a rich language to specify queueing models and decouples the model description from the solvers used for its solution. This is done through model-to-model transformations that automatically translate the model specification into the input format (or data structure) accepted by the target solver.

Supported models include extended queueing networks, both open and closed, and layered queueing networks. Wrappers are integrated in LINE that are able to invoke external solvers such as [JMT](http://jmt.sourceforge.net/) and [LQNS/LQSIM](http://www.sce.carleton.ca/rads/lqns/lqn-documentation/). LINE also features several native model solvers written in the MATLAB language and based on continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC), fluid ordinary differential equations, matrix analytic methods (MAM), normalizing constant analysis, and approximate mean-value analysis (AMVA). 

To get started, clone the repository (dev release) or download the latest stable release from the [Releases](https://github.com/line-solver/line/releases) page and unzip the file in the chosen installation folder.

Start MATLAB and change the active directory to the installation folder. Then add all LINE folders to the path
```
addpath(genpath(pwd))
```
Finally, run the LINE demonstrators using
```
allExamples
```
Detailed guidance on how to use the engine is provided in the [User Manual](https://github.com/line-solver/line/raw/master/doc/LINE.pdf).

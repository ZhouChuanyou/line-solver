## LINE: Performance and Reliability Analysis Engine

Current version: 2.0.0-BETA (BSD-3 License)

Website: http://line-solver.sourceforge.net/

Latest stable release: https://sourceforge.net/projects/line-solver/files/latest/download

LINE is a MATLAB toolbox for performance and reliability analysis of systems and processes that can be modeled using queueing theory. The engine offers a solver-agnostic language to specify queueing networks, which therefore decouples model description from the solvers used for their solution. This is done through model-to-model transformations that automatically translate the model specification into the input format (or data structure) accepted by the target solver.

Supported models include *extended queueing networks*, both open and closed, and *layered queueing networks*. Models can be solved with either native or external solvers, the latter include [JMT](http://jmt.sourceforge.net/) and [LQNS](http://www.sce.carleton.ca/rads/lqns/). Native solvers are based on continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC), fluid ordinary differential equations, matrix analytic methods (MAM), normalizing constant analysis, and mean-value analysis (MVA). 

### Getting started

To get started, expand the archive (or clone the repository) in the chosen installation folder.

Start MATLAB and change the active directory to the installation folder. Then add all LINE folders to the path
```
addpath(genpath(pwd))
```
Finally, run the LINE demonstrators using
```
allExamples
```

### Documentation
Getting started examples and detailed instructions on how to use LINE are provided in the [User Manual](https://github.com/line-solver/line/raw/master/doc/LINE.pdf) and on the [Wiki](https://github.com/line-solver/line/wiki).
